    /// A direction in which text flows.
    ///
    /// Some languages are written from the left to the right (for example, English,
    /// Tamil, or Chinese), while others are written from the right to the left (for
    /// example Aramaic, Hebrew, or Urdu). Some are also written in a mixture, for
    /// example Arabic is mostly written right-to-left, with numerals written
    /// left-to-right.
    ///
    /// The text direction must be provided to APIs that render text or lay out
    /// boxes horizontally, so that they can determine which direction to start in:
    /// either right-to-left, [TextDirection.rtl]; or left-to-right,
    /// [TextDirection.ltr].
    ///
    /// ## Design discussion
    ///
    /// Flutter is designed to address the needs of applications written in any of
    /// the world's currently-used languages, whether they use a right-to-left or
    /// left-to-right writing direction. Flutter does not support other writing
    /// modes, such as vertical text or boustrophedon text, as these are rarely used
    /// in computer programs.
    ///
    /// It is common when developing user interface frameworks to pick a default
    /// text direction — typically left-to-right, the direction most familiar to the
    /// engineers working on the framework — because this simplifies the development
    /// of applications on the platform. Unfortunately, this frequently results in
    /// the platform having unexpected left-to-right biases or assumptions, as
    /// engineers will typically miss places where they need to support
    /// right-to-left text. This then results in bugs that only manifest in
    /// right-to-left environments.
    ///
    /// In an effort to minimize the extent to which Flutter experiences this
    /// category of issues, the lowest levels of the Flutter framework do not have a
    /// default text reading direction. Any time a reading direction is necessary,
    /// for example when text is to be displayed, or when a
    /// writing-direction-dependent value is to be interpreted, the reading
    /// direction must be explicitly specified. Where possible, such as in `switch`
    /// statements, the right-to-left case is listed first, to avoid the impression
    /// that it is an afterthought.
    ///
    /// At the higher levels (specifically starting at the widgets library), an
    /// ambient [Directionality] is introduced, which provides a default. Thus, for
    /// instance, a [Text] widget in the scope of a [MaterialApp] widget does not
    /// need to be given an explicit writing direction. The [Directionality.of]
    /// static method can be used to obtain the ambient text direction for a
    /// particular [BuildContext].
    ///
    /// ### Known left-to-right biases in Flutter
    ///
    /// Despite the design intent described above, certain left-to-right biases have
    /// nonetheless crept into Flutter's design. These include:
    ///
    ///  * The [Canvas] origin is at the top left, and the x-axis increases in a
    ///    left-to-right direction.
    ///
    ///  * The default localization in the widgets and material libraries is
    ///    American English, which is left-to-right.
    ///
    /// ### Visual properties vs directional properties
    ///
    /// Many classes in the Flutter framework are offered in two versions, a
    /// visually-oriented variant, and a text-direction-dependent variant. For
    /// example, [EdgeInsets] is described in terms of top, left, right, and bottom,
    /// while [EdgeInsetsDirectional] is described in terms of top, start, end, and
    /// bottom, where start and end correspond to right and left in right-to-left
    /// text and left and right in left-to-right text.
    ///
    /// There are distinct use cases for each of these variants.
    ///
    /// Text-direction-dependent variants are useful when developing user interfaces
    /// that should "flip" with the text direction. For example, a paragraph of text
    /// in English will typically be left-aligned and a quote will be indented from
    /// the left, while in Arabic it will be right-aligned and indented from the
    /// right. Both of these cases are described by the direction-dependent
    /// [TextAlign.start] and [EdgeInsetsDirectional.start].
    ///
    /// In contrast, the visual variants are useful when the text direction is known
    /// and not affected by the reading direction. For example, an application
    /// giving driving directions might show a "turn left" arrow on the left and a
    /// "turn right" arrow on the right — and would do so whether the application
    /// was localized to French (left-to-right) or Hebrew (right-to-left).
    ///
    /// In practice, it is also expected that many developers will only be
    /// targeting one language, and in that case it may be simpler to think in
    /// visual terms.
